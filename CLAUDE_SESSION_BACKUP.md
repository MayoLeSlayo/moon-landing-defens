### Response Structure for Each Theory

Each conspiracy theory includes:
- **Short Response**: Social media optimized (âš¡ Quick Comeback)
- **Comprehensive Response**: Medium detail (ðŸ“– Extended Explanation)  
- **Educational Response**: In-depth analysis (ðŸ”¬ Full Breakdown)

### Technical Issues Resolved

#### Major Build Error Fixed
- **Problem**: Duplicate `export const conspiracyTheories` arrays causing compilation failure
- **Root Cause**: Added new theories to second array instead of merging with original
- **Solution**: Merged all new theories into original array (lines 748-851), removed duplicate
- **Status**: âœ… Resolved

#### Key File Locations
- **Main Data File**: `/src/data/conspiracies.ts`
- **Evidence Page**: `/src/app/evidence/[slug]/page.tsx`
- **Response Component**: `/src/components/ResponseCard.tsx`

### Content Enhancement Patterns

#### Response Naming Convention
- âš¡ **Quick Comeback** (short): Social media ready, key facts only
- ðŸ“– **Extended Explanation** (comprehensive): Medium detail with main points
- ðŸ”¬ **Full Breakdown** (educational): Complete technical analysis

#### Formatting Standards
- **Bold text** for key measurements and technical terms
- **## Headings** for major sections
- **### Subheadings** for detailed breakdowns
- Inline links: `[text](url)` format
- Source separation from content text

#### Scientific Accuracy Requirements
- All technical claims backed by physics/engineering principles
- International verification emphasized (China, India, Japan, USSR)
- Modern technology comparisons (SpaceX, commercial space)
- Expert consensus and peer review references

### File Structure Updates

```
src/data/conspiracies.ts:
â”œâ”€â”€ sources[] (lines 3-265)
â”œâ”€â”€ evidenceResponses[] (lines 750-2230) 
â””â”€â”€ conspiracyTheories[] (lines 267-852)
    â”œâ”€â”€ [original theories] (lines 268-747)
    â””â”€â”€ [8 new theories] (lines 748-851)
```

### Source Integration

Each theory references appropriate scientific sources:
- `lro-images`: Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter photography
- `royal-museums-greenwich`: Royal Museums Greenwich analysis
- `soviet-tracking`: Soviet independent verification
- `jodrell-bank`: Jodrell Bank Observatory tracking
- `smithsonian-verification`: Smithsonian Institution validation
- `clavius-kaysing`: Clavius Moon Base Bill Kaysing analysis

### Content Quality Standards

#### Technical Accuracy
- Physics calculations verified (angular size, thrust-to-weight ratios, delta-V)
- Engineering principles validated (rocket staging, telescope resolution)
- Historical timelines confirmed (employment records, mission dates)

#### Evidence-Based Responses
- International verification emphasized throughout
- Modern technology validation included
- Expert consensus documented
- Peer-reviewed sources referenced

#### Engagement Optimization
- Social media friendly short responses
- Bold formatting for key facts
- Paragraph breaks for readability
- Copy functionality for sharing

### Known Issues & Limitations

#### Shell Environment
- Persistent zsh errors in terminal (confirmed harmless by user)
- Commands execute successfully despite error messages
- No impact on actual development work

#### Build System
- Next.js 14.2.0 noted as outdated in build messages
- Application builds and runs successfully on localhost:3000
- No functional issues identified

### Next Steps Recommendations

1. **Test Build**: Verify all new theories display properly
2. **SEO Validation**: Check that new theory pages generate correctly
3. **Performance Check**: Ensure search functionality includes new theories
4. **Content Review**: User testing of new response formats

### Session Context Preservation

This session continued from previous work that had established:
- ResponseCard component with copy functionality
- Evidence page structure with 3-response format
- Database of 39+ conspiracy theories (now 47+)
- Scientific source system with credibility scoring

### Development Environment
- **Location**: `/Users/lebeast/Claude/MayoSlayo_Sites/moon-landing-defense`
- **Platform**: macOS (Darwin 24.3.0)
- **Framework**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **Development Server**: http://localhost:3000
- **Git Status**: Ready for commit (duplicate issue resolved)
