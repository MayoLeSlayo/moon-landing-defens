    content: 'This is the classic "waving flag" conspiracy theory that completely misses the point. There is no wind on the moon - that\'s exactly why the flag looks the way it does. The flag only appears to "wave" when astronauts are physically moving it during setup, then it stops completely because there\'s no air to make it flutter. The flag has a horizontal rod at the top to keep it extended, and the wrinkles from being folded stay frozen in place because there\'s no atmosphere. If you watch the actual footage, whenever astronauts aren\'t touching the flag, it\'s perfectly motionless - exactly what you\'d expect in a vacuum. The flag\'s behavior actually proves the moon landing was real because it acts nothing like a flag would in a windy Earth studio.',
